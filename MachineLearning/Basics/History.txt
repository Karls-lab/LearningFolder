1940 - 1960
    Simple Linear models 
    Weights not learned, had to be manually inputted by a human. 
    Theories of biological learning, simple binary classification. 

    Implementation of perception. Enable training of a single neuron. 

    Adaptive Linear Element (ADALINE) predicts real number (regression)
    while the weights are trained by SGD. Failed to learn nonlinear function 
    like XOR. First wave stopped. 


1960 - 1970
    Decision trees and K-nearest neighbors


1980 - 1990
    Connectionism and neural networks. 
    Back propagation was developed. 
    LSTM was developed

1990 - 2000
    Search Vector Machines
    Bagging and boosting. 2nd wave died 

2000 - Present 
    Large datasets and faster computers enabled the 3rd wave of AI 
    Deep learning (2010) focused on many layers, started the Golden age of AI 
    TensorFlow and Pytorch enabled rapid development.
