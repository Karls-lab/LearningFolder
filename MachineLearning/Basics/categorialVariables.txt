So there are two ways to convert categorical data into numerical data. 
1. Label Encoding:
    This can only be used with ordinal data, where the categories have a natural order.

2. One Hot Encoding:
    This can be used with nominal data, where the categories do not have a natural order.
    Each category is converted into a new column, and a 1 or 0 is used to indicate 
    the presence of that category.
