Guide to how browsers send data across the internet.

METHOD:
    This specifies the method of communication, can be GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

HEADERS:
    Headers are little notes that the browser sends to the server to tell it more about the request.
    They can tell the server what kind of data you can handle, or if you've visited the site before 
    and have a cookie, or if you're logged in, etc.

    1. Request Headers:
        User-Agent: This tells the server what kind of browser you're using.
        Accept: This tells the server what kind of data you can handle.
        Authorization: might contain logon credentials.

    2. General Headers:
        Apply to both requests and responses. 
        Cache-Control: This tells the server how to cache the data.
        Host: This tells the server what domain you're trying to access.
        Connection: This tells the server if you want to keep the connection open.
