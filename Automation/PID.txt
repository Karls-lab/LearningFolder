A PID controller is like a smart adjustment system that keeps 
things steady—whether it’s a car’s cruise control, a thermostat, or a drone hovering in place.

It works by constantly checking the error 
(the difference between the desired value and the actual value) 
and adjusting the system to correct it.

PID Tuning is the process of adjusting 
Proportional (P), Integral (I), and Derivative (D) 
parameters to optimize a PID controller’s performance.

PID Components:
    P (Proportional): Reacts to current error, increasing response speed.
    I (Integral): Addresses past errors, eliminating steady-state error.
    D (Derivative): Predicts future errors, improving stability.

Tuning Methods:
    Trial & Error: Manually adjusting parameters.
    Ziegler-Nichols: Systematic method using oscillation tests.
    Bump Test: Applying a disturbance and calculating response.
    Autotuning Software: Automates tuning for efficiency.

A well-tuned PID ensures stable, responsive, and efficient control.


The Ziegler-Nichols method is a popular way to tune a PID controller 
by systematically finding the best P, I, and D values. 
It helps achieve a good balance between stability and responsiveness.
How It Works (Steps):

    Set I and D to zero – Start with only the Proportional (P) term.
    Increase P until the system oscillates – Gradually raise P until the 
    system starts to oscillate at a constant amplitude (this is called the ultimate gain, Ku).
    Record the oscillation period (Pu) – Measure the time for one full oscillation cycle.
    Use the Ziegler-Nichols table – Plug Ku and Pu into predefined 
    formulas to calculate P, I, and D values.

Ziegler-Nichols Tuning Rules:
Controller Type	P	I	D
P	0.5 * Ku	—	—
PI	0.45 * Ku	Pu / 1.2	—
PID	0.6 * Ku	Pu / 2	Pu / 8
