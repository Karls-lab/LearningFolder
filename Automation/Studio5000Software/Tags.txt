It's impossible to reorganize tags once they are created, the solution is to export your tags as a csv, 
edit them there, and then reimport them. 

I've left a program I found online called Tag Converter.py, which can easily import all of your Factory IO 
tags with their description into Studio 5000

I've learned the best way to organize controller tags is to first import them/define them like normal, and 
create a User Defined Tag (UDT). This way I can accesss inputs and outputs like this:
Tank[0].Level or Tank[1].Level or Tank[0].Flow  
Much easier to understand and work with! 
Now, create a subroutine to map the BOOL_IN_0 tags into the UDT. Example: 
TankIOArray[0].LevelMeter := IN_FLOAT_0;
TankIOArray[0].FlowMeter := IN_FLOAT_1;
