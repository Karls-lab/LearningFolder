Find the Path to Your Program:
Find the full path to your Python program. Let's say your program is in /path/to/your/program.

Add the Program to PATH:

    On Windows:
        Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables."
        Click on "Edit the system environment variables."
        Click the "Environment Variables" button.
        In the "System variables" section, scroll down and select the "Path" variable.
        Click "Edit."
        Click "New" and add the path to your program (e.g., C:\path\to\your\program).
        Click "OK" to close each dialog.

    On macOS/Linux:
        Open your shell profile file (e.g., ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.profile).
        Add the following line to the file, replacing /path/to/your/program with the actual path:

        bash

            export PATH="/path/to/your/program:$PATH"

            Save the file.
            Run source ~/.bashrc (or the corresponding file) to apply the changes.

    Verify:
    Open a new terminal or command prompt window and type the name of your program. It should now be recognized and executable from any location.

Remember to replace "your_program" and "/path/to/your/program" with the actual name of your program and its path.


**** If you are trying to run a python program from terminal, add this to the first line in main: 
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
