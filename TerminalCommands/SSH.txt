1. Install the OpenSSH server or client (Should already be installed)
    sudo apt install openssh-server 
    sudo apt install openssh-client

2. Start the OpenSSH server (will start on boot now)
    sudo systemctl start sshd
    sudo systemctl enable sshd
    sudo systemctl status sshd

3. Configure Firewall
    sudo ufw allow ssh
    sudo ufw enable
    sudo ufw status

3. Generate Key pair (if you haven't already)
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
        -t = type of encryption (rsa)
        -b = number of bits in the key (4096) which is stronger than the default 2048

5. Transfer public SSH key (your computer you want to connect from) to the server
    ssh username@remote_host
        Type in password
    ssh-copy-id username@server_ip
