PERMISSIONS 
    User accounts are saved under /etc/group files and passwords are saved under /etc/passwd 
    The ls -l command lists the file's permissions. 
    Owner: rwx  Group: rwx  World: rwx 
    r: read, w: write, x: allows a file to be executed. 
    id              Display user identity 
    chmod           Change a file's mode
        CHMOD GUIDE:
        chmod 600 foo.txt -> -rx------- 
        7(rwx), 6(rw-), 5(r-x), 4(r--), 0(---)
        ADDITIONAL CHMOD IDEAS:
            u + x           Add execute permissions for the owner 
            u - x           Remove execute permissions from the owner 
            +   x           Add execute permissions to user, group and world 
            u               Short for user

            a               Short for 'all', meaning u + g + o
    umask           Set the default file permissions 
    su              Run a shell command as another user
