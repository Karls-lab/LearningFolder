Things I've learned when working with a team of developers:
    1. Give ownership to team members. Give them certain responsibilities and 
         let them take charge of their work.
    2. Give lots of mini-deadlines. Lots of people don't do anything until the last minute.
    3. Use availability scheduling and make a plan. 
    4. Communicate properly.
