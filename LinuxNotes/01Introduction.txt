There are three parts of the Linux system: the kernel, the shell, and the programs.
kernel: the core of the system, responsible for managing the hardware, running the programs, and maintaining the file system.
shell: the interface between the user and the kernel, which allows the user to interact with the system.
programs: the applications that run on the system, such as text editors, web browsers, and games.

The BASH is the most common shell used in Linux systems. It stands for "Bourne Again SHell" 

the file /etc/passwd conatins the users's information like: 
 username, group id, user id, home directory, and the shell that the user uses.
The shadow file /etc/shadow contains the encrypted passwords of the users.

The operating system manages programs. Each program makes system calls to the kernel to request resources.
