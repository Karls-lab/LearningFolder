multiple criteria can be chained together with -a (and) or -o (or)

You can also pipe the output of the find command to less 

use the whereis command to find the file paths of a command that is attached to your path 
whereis [OPTION] [Name]
Example: whereis pip 
output: pip: /usr/bin/pip /usr/local/bin/pip /home/x1b3d3ad/.local/bin/pip /usr/share/man/man1/pip.1.gz

common options:
-b 	Search for binaries.
-m 	Search for manual pages.
