Archiving: combining multiple files into one file 
Compression: reducing the size of a file

The tar command bundles files together for archiving.
tar -cvf archive.tar file1 file2 file3 

gzip [OPTIONS] file
gzip by default replaces the file, so use the -c option to keep the original file
gzip -c numbers.txt > numbers.txt.gz - gzip sends the compression to stout, which is redirected to a file

The gunzip command is used to decompress a file
gunzip [OPTIONS] file.gz
It's just gzip called with different parameters. 
use gunzip -l to list the contents of a compressed file
gzip can recursively compress every file in the directory using the -r arg
zcat = gunzip -c Can be used to view the contents of a compressed file

The bzip2 and bunzip2 are symmetrical to gzip and gunzip
They offer better compression, but are slower. Compression about ~10% better than gzip

*** Honestly, just use zip and unzip for all compression, because its supported on all systems ***

The tar command is used to group files together. You'll commonly see compressed file in the format of file.tar.gz
tar is short for 'tape archive'
Three main options: create, extract, list. 
tar -c [-f ARCHIVE] [OPTIONS] [FILE...] - create an archive
c = create, f = file, v = verbose, z = gzip, j = bzip2, -J = xz, -x = extract, -t = list
EXAMPLE: tar -cvzf mydocuments.tar.gz ~/Documents


The dd command is used to copy entire partitions and hard drives. 
if=FILE 	The input file to be read.
of=FILE 	The output file to be written.
bs=SIZE 	The block size to be used. By default, the value is considered to be in bytes. 
             Use the following suffixes to specify other units: K, M, G, and T for kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, and terabytes respectively.
count=NUMBER 	The number of blocks to read from the input file.
EXAMPLE:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/swapex bs=1M count=500 - count and block size are needed if not entire hard drive
dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb - This command copies the entire sda drive to sdb
dd if=/dev/dvd of=dvd.iso - This command copies the contents of a DVD to a file called dvd.iso

/dev/sda 	first hard drive on the system.
/dev/sdb 	second hard drive on the system.
/dev/dvd 	first DVD drive on the system.
