All commands follow a philosophy of accepting text as input and producing text as output.

When command output is run without any errors, the output is standard output (stdout). 
When there is an error, the output is standard error (stderr).
The > operator is used to redirect stdout to a file.
Example: redirect the output of ls ~ (list the home directory) to a file called home.txt
    ls ~ > home.txt

>> appends the text, > overrides the text
&> redirects both stdout and stderr to a file, overrides
