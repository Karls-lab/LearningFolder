All commands follow a philosophy of accepting text as input and producing text as output.

When command output is run without any errors, the output is standard output (stdout). 
When there is an error, the output is standard error (stderr).
The > operator is used to redirect stdout to a file.
Example: redirect the output of ls ~ (list the home directory) to a file called home.txt
    ls ~ > home.txt

>> appends the text, > overrides the text
&> redirects both stdout and stderr to a file, overrides
2>&1 redirect both stdout and stderr to a file.

Put #!/bin/sh at the first line of a file to specify it as standard input

The | command pipes the output of the left command to the command on the right. 

The tee command outputs the command while also writing to a file
ls | tee output.txt
