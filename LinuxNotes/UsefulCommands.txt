If you want more flexibility and ability to run missed jobs, use systemd timers 
Systemd files are stored in /etc/systemd/system
Create a new file with the .service extension
Example Script: 
    [Unit]
    Description=My Custom Systemd Service
    After=network.target  # Only runs after the network is up (optional)

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/home/username/my-script.sh
    Restart=on-failure  # Restart on failure (optional)
    User=username  # Optional, to run the script as a specific user

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target  # Makes the service start when the system is in multi-user mode
