# I will attempt to decipher this code:
# 10680-70908-05478-04576

# Guess: Something to do with ceaser cipher/Trasposition sort?
# Each block is 5 characters long, is this a 4 letter word?
# Guess: Jazz, quiz, joke, czar, etc... 

# in each 5 character block, the first 2 is a ceaser cipher, and the last three is the Oct representation of the character.
