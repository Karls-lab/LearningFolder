Four most important security AWS Things to do:
    - Keep your software up to date 
    - Restrict access to your AWS account 
    - Control networking traffic to and from EC2 
    - Create a private network in AWS

Security is not just protecting yourself form attackers, but 
preventing mistakes form yourself and coworkers. 
- Don't save passwords in plaintext and use TLS/SSL for traffic 

Install updates at boot or shutdown. 
    apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
    dnf -y update
    yum -y update

Use AWS Systems Manager for patch management.

IAM: Identity and Access Management
    - Users 
    - Groups 
    - Roles 
    - Policies
Deny always wins over allow. 

Managed policy: 
    Can be reused, can either be a preset policy (AWS) or a custom one
Inline policy:
    Attached to a single user, group, or role.
Inline are more flexible, but harder to manage.

Example Creating an IAM user 
Password: 7TwaddUpvow$ (SEVEN-Twadd-Up-vow-DOLLAR_SIGN)
    aws iam create-group --group-name "admin"
    aws iam attach-group-policy --group-name "admin" --policy-arn / 
        "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess"
    aws iam create-user --user-name "myuser"
    aws iam add-user-to-group --group-name "admin" --user-name "myuser"
    aws iam create-login-profile --user-name "myuser" --password '7TwaddUpvow$'
