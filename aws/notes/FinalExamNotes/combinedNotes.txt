MODULE 10 NOTES - AUTOSCALING AND LOAD BALANCING

Section 1: Elastic Load Balancing 
    With millions of incoming connections, elastic load balancing 
    automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple
    targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and
    Lambda functions. It can handle the varying load of your application
    traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability
    Zones. 
    Elastic Load Balancing offers three types of load balancers
    1. Application Load Balancers: HTTP and HTTPS traffic
    2. Network Load Balancers: TCP, TLS, and UDP traffic (extreme performance)
    3. Classic Load Balancers: HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and SSL traffic (everything else)

    Application and Network balance by targeting certain groups 
    Classic targets EC2 instances

    Load Balancing Monitoring:
    1. CloudWatch Metrics: alarm if goes outside of metrics 
    2. Access logs: detailed information 
    3. AWS CloudTrail logs: who, what, when, and where someone did something. 


Section 2: Amazon CloudWatch
    Metrics, Dashboards, Logs, Events, Canary Tests, Container Insights, Integration 
    Threshold must be definite like code. 

Section 3: Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling 
    Amazon Web Services (AWS) Auto Scaling is a service that automatically adjusts the capacity of your AWS resources to handle varying workloads. It helps you ensure that your applications are both highly available and cost-efficient by automatically adding or removing resources based on predefined scaling policies. Auto Scaling is commonly used with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, but it can also be used with other AWS services.

Key features and concepts of AWS Auto Scaling include:

    Scaling Groups:
        Auto Scaling uses groups to organize and manage instances that are launched from a common Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
        Scaling groups define the minimum, desired, and maximum number of instances to maintain.

    Scaling Policies:
        Scaling policies define the conditions under which Auto Scaling should add or remove instances.
        You can create policies based on various metrics like CPU utilization, network traffic, or custom CloudWatch metrics.

    Launch Configurations or Launch Templates:
        These configurations specify the instance type, AMI, and other settings for instances launched by Auto Scaling.
        Launch configurations are being phased out in favor of launch templates.

    Dynamic Scaling:
        Auto Scaling can automatically adjust the number of instances based on changing traffic patterns and performance metrics.
        It can scale out (add instances) during traffic spikes and scale in (remove instances) during periods of lower demand.

    Scheduled Scaling:
        You can schedule scaling actions to occur at specific times or dates.
        This is useful for handling predictable traffic patterns or planned maintenance events.

    Target Tracking Scaling:
        Auto Scaling can target a specific metric (e.g., CPU utilization) and automatically adjust the number of instances to maintain a predefined target value.

    Simple and Step Scaling:
        Simple scaling policies allow you to specify static adjustments (e.g., add or remove a fixed number of instances).
        Step scaling policies allow you to specify adjustments based on various conditions and steps.

    Integration with Application Load Balancers:
        Auto Scaling works seamlessly with Application Load Balancers (ALB) to distribute traffic evenly across instances.

    Integration with AWS CloudWatch:
        Auto Scaling leverages Amazon CloudWatch to monitor metrics and trigger scaling events based on alarms and thresholds.

    Instance Termination Policies:
        You can define policies that determine which instances should be terminated when scaling in.

AWS Auto Scaling simplifies the management of your infrastructure by 
automating the scaling process based on your application's requirements and 
resource usage. It helps you maintain application availability, 
optimize resource utilization, and reduce operational overhead.


AWS INTRODUCTION NOTES 


Amazon VPC:
    Stands for Virtual Private Cloud 
    Creates a logically isolated section in the AWS cloud 

    Benefits:
        Isolation
        Custom IP Address Ranges 
        Subnets(different availability zones, but same region)
        Security Groups (Amazon firewalls)
        VPN Connectivity for secure access
        Transit Gateways: VPC can talk to each other directly 
        VPC can talk to other Amazon Services without going through the internet 

    Subnets are given 256 IP addresses, but some are reserved, so only 251 available 

    A route table specifies where things should be routed too. 
    By default, each route table has a default local pointer for local communication 


VPC Networking:
    VPC can come with an internet gateway that is scalable. It 
    helps the VPC connect to the internet

    A NAT helps the VPC connect to the internet and prevents random internet connections 
    from messing anything up. It allows address translation
    Enables instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet

    VPC endpoint: Connects your VPC to supported AWS services

    VPC peering: Connects your VPC to other VPCs

    AWS Site to Site VPN: Connects your VPC to remote networks

    AWS Transit Gateway: A hub and spoke connection alternative to VPC peering


VPC Security
    Each instance of an VPC has it's own Security group
    A security group filters traffic like a firewall 
    Default: Allow all outbound, deny all inbound 

    You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules 

    A network ACL (Access control list) is optional. It is like 
    a firewall for one or more subnets. ACL's can allow or deny traffic 
    It's stateless, meaning return traffic must be explicitly allowed
    By default, ACL's deny everything 


Amazon Route 53 
    Route 53 is a DNS web service. 
    Routes names like example.com into 192.168.1.1
    Features traffic flow
    You can buy domain names directly through the service. 
    Health check on endpoints
    Provides logging and monitoring 


Amazon CloudFront 
    Fast, secure, CDN service for global reach 
    They use edge locations to reach globally. 
    Module 6 - Compute 

Section 01: Compute Services Overview 

Quick Overview of Compute Services:
    Amazon EC2: resizable compute capacity in the cloud
    Elastic Beanstalk: run and manage web apps
    Lambda: run code without provisioning or managing servers

    Instance based Computing: 
        AWS Batch: run batch jobs at any scale
        Lightsail: launch and manage virtual private servers
        AWS far gate: run containers without managing servers or clusters

    
Section 02: Amazon EC2 
    EC2 provides resizable servers on the cloud to host your servers 

    Steps to Create an EC2:
        1. choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
        2. Choose an Instance Type
            Types: 
                a, m, t: general purpose 
                c: compute optimized
                r,x , z: memory optimized
                f,g,p: accelerated computing
                d,h,i: storage optimized
        3. Specify network settings 
        4. Attach IAM role (optional)
            An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions.
        5. User data script 
            User data is a script that runs when an instance starts. 
            You can use it to install packages or write files to the instance.
        6. Add storage
            EBS: Elastic Block Storage, it is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run.
        7. Add tags (optional)
            Tags are labels you can attach to your AWS resources.
            They are used to identify, organize, and search for your resources.
        8. Configure security groups
            A security group is a virtual firewall that controls the traffic for one or more instances.
            When you launch an instance, you associate one or more security groups with the instance.
            You add rules to each security group that allow traffic to or from its associated instances.
        9. Identify or create the key pair 
            A key pair, consisting of a private key and a public key, is a set of security credentials 
            that you use to prove your identity when connecting to an instance.Amazon EC2 stores the public key, 
            and you store the private key. You use the private key to connect to your instance.
        
        Use Cloud Watch to monitor your EC2 instances
        User scripts configure your instance when it boots up
        Only instances that are backed up by EBS can be stopped


Section 03: Amazon EC2 Cost optimization 
    
    Spiky workloads: 
        Use on-demand instances

    Time-Insensitive workloads:
        Use reserved instances

    Steady-state workloads:
        Use spot instances

    Highly sensitive workloads:
        Use dedicated hosts

    Four pillars of cost optimization:
        1. Right sizing
        2. Optimize pricing model 
        3. Increase elasticity
        4. Optimize storage

    Spot instances are spare EC2 instances that are available at a discount compared to on-demand pricing.
        They are cheaper than on-demand instances, but can be taken away from you at any time 
        if your max price is less than the current spot price.

    
Section 04: Container Services 
    Containers are a method of operating system virtualization 
    Benefits: 
        - Lightweight
        - Portable
        - Loosely coupled
        - Scalable
        - Secure
        - faster to start or stope than EC2 instances

    What is Docker? 
        Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. 
        Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, 
        such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

    Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) 
        is a container service. Runs docker containers on EC2 instances.
        Kind of the same as EC2 but with containers.
        A task is a running container on an EC2 instance.

        Amazon ECS cluster options: Do you want to manage the ECS cluster that runs the containers? 
            Yes: Create an ECS cluster. 
            No: Use Fargate, which is a serverless compute engine for containers.

    What is Kubernetics? (EKS)
        Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management.
        It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
        It manages all of your docker applications. Automates a bunch of things. 
        Amazon calls it Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS)

    Amazon Elastics Container Registry (ECR)
        is a fully-managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy 
        Docker container images. Amazon ECR is integrated with Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS),
        simplifying your development to production workflow. Amazon ECR eliminates the need to operate 
        your own container repositories or worry about scaling the underlying infrastructure.
        Amazon ECR hosts your images in a highly available and scalable architecture, allowing you
        to reliably deploy containers for your applications. Integration with AWS Identity and 
        Access Management (IAM) provides resource-level control of each repository.


Section 05: AWS Lambda
    AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service. 
    You create a lambda function, which is the AWS resource that contains the code that you upload. 
    You can then invoke the function over the internet via an API call or from an AWS service that triggers the function.
    You can also have it on a timer. 
    * You only pay for the time your code is running.

    Benefits:
        - No servers to manage
        - Continuous scaling
        - Subsecond metering
        - Integrated with the whole AWS platform
        - Easy to get started

    Use cases:
        - Web, mobile, and IoT backends
        - Real-time file processing
        - Stream processing
        - Extract, transform, and load (ETL)
        - Operational automation
        - Chatbots

    Hard limits: 
        RAM: 10GB
        Function timeout: 15min
        Package size: 250 MB unzipped 
        Image code packet size: 10GB 


Section 06: Introduction to Elastic Beanstalk 
    Elastic Beanstalk is a service for deploying and scaling web applications and services.
    Pay for only what you use. 
MODULE 07 STORAGE 

General Overview of Storage: 
    Instance Store is temporary storage that is physically attached to the host computer for an instance.

    EBS (Elastic Block Store) is persistent storage that can be attached to an instance.

    EFS (Elastic File System) is persistent storage that can be attached to multiple instances.

    S3 (Simple Storage Service) is object storage that can be used to store and 
        retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.

    S3 Glacier is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost storage service for data archiving and long-term backup.


Section 01: Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
    Block Storage vs Object Storage:
        Block you only need to change the character in the file. Object you need to change the whole file.
    EBS allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to EC2 instances.
    Volumes are automatically replicated within the availability zone. 

    Volume types: 
        General Purpose SSD (GP2) - General purpose, balances both price and performance.
        Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1) - Designed for I/O intensive applications such as large relational or NoSQL databases.
        Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1) - Big data, data warehouses, log processing.
        Cold HDD (SC1) - Lowest cost storage for infrequently accessed workloads.

    Other EBS features:
        Snapshots
        Encryption 
        Elasticity: increase capacity, change to different types 

    Volumes are independent of the life of an instance.

    EBS Charges: snapshots per GB per month 
        Inbound data transfer is free. Outbound data transfer is charged per GB.

   
Section 02: Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
        Simple storage is object based storage. This means if you want to modify/change a file, you 
        must download the entire file, make the changes, and upload the entire file again.

        S3 stores data as objects within buckets. Buckets are folders. Objects are files.
        Designed for 11 9's durability, Single object size is 0 bytes to 5 TB. Unlimited storage.
        You could take entire snapshots of databases into a single object. 
        
        S3 buckets are stored in a region and are backed up to multiple availability zones in the same region. 

        S3 offers different types of storage classes: 
            S3 standard - used for most everything, super durable.
            S3 Intelligent-Tiering - moves data to the most cost-effective tier. 
            S3 Standard Infrequent Access (IA) - for data that is accessed less frequently, 
                                            but requires rapid access when needed.
            S3 Glacier - very cheap, but used for archival only.
            S3 Glacier Deep Archive - cheapest, but used for archival only. 
                Data this is accessed once or twice a year. Spread about 3 availability zones 

        S3 Bucket URLs (two styles):
            regional style: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru
            path style: https://acloudguru.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com

        Access the data from S3 from anywhere. You can use AWS console, CMD interface, or SDK. 

        Use Cases: 
            Backup and storage
            Disaster recovery
            Archive
            Big data analytics
            Hybrid cloud storage
            Cloud-native applications
            Static website hosting

        Encryption: 
            S3 encryption is at the server side.
            types of S3 encryption: 
                S3 managed keys - SSE-S3
                AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys - SSE-KMS
                Server Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys - SSE-C
                Client Side Encryption - CSE/

        Payment/Charges:
            You do not pay for data into S3 or transfer to other amazon services in the same region.
            Pay for storage, requests, and storage management.
        Things to consider: 
            1. Storage class type (tiers) 
            2. Amount of storage 
            3. Requests, Number and type 
            4. Data Transfer, watch out for transfer out of availability zones. 


Section 03: Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)
    Will grow and shrink automatically without disturbing the application. 
    Uses the NFS (network file system) protocol.

    Works well with: 
        Big data 
        Media processing 
        Content management
        Web serving 
        Home directories 

    Low latency, shared storage, highly available, scalable, and elastic file system.
    Can run in multiple availability zones.


Section 04: Amazon S3 Glacier 
    Secure, durable, low cost for archiving and long-term backup.
    Three terms:
        Archive - what you are storing in Glacier.
        Vault - container for archives.
        Vault access policy - controls access to vaults.

    Three options to retrieve data from Glacier:
        Expedited - 1 to 5 minutes
        Standard - 3 to 5 hours
        Bulk - 5 to 12 hours

    Use Cases:
        Media archives
        Healthcare and financial records
        Regulatory archives
        Scientific data
        Digital preservation

    Besides creating and deleting vaults, You must use the SDK or API. 

    Lifecycle policies can be used to move objects from S3 to Glacier or to automatically delete objects based on age.
    S3 -> 30d ays -> Infrequent Access -> 60 days -> Glacier -> 365 days -> Delete
    Glacier is more expensive to retrieve data from than S3, but is cheaper to store. 

    MODULE 8, DATABASES

All relational databases offered from amazon can be managed from 
the AWS console, CLI, or SDK.

Section 1: Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)
        
    Unmanaged vs. Managed Databases
        Unmanaged: Scaling, Patching, Backups, High Availability, Monitoring, Replication, Failover, etc.
                    Must all be done manually
        Managed: AWS handles all of the above for you

    Challenge of relational databases:
        1. Server maintenance
        2. Software update and patches 
        3. Backups 
        4. Scaling
        5. Data Security 

    If your database in on EC2, then you still need to patch, updates, and backup 
    RDS or Aurora, auto scales for you, manage backups and patching for you. 

    Managed Responsibilities
        You manage:
            Application optimization 
        AWS manages:
            OS installation and patching
            DB installation and patching
            Automated backups
            Availability and reliability
            Scaling 
            Server maintenance

    The basic building block is a database instance. 
        Supports: MySQL, Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MariaDB. 

    Usually the DB instance is in a private cloud. 

    Read replicas: 
        Used for scaling read operations. 
        Can be in the same region or cross region. 
        Can be in the same VPC or cross VPC. 
        Can be in the same account or cross account.

    Use cases:
        Web and mobile applications 
        Ecommerce applications
        Mobile and online games 


    Do not use RDS when: 
        Massive read writes (150,000 per sec)
        Sharding 
        Simple GET and PUT a noSQL database is better.

    use RDS when:
        You want a managed service 
        You want to use a relational database 
        You want to scale read operations 
        You want to use a familiar database engine 
        You want to use a database that is highly available and scalable

    Cost considerations:
        1. Clock hours/service time 
        2. Which resources incur charges 

    Purchase types:
        1. On-demand: compute capacity by the hour 
        2. Reserved instances: One time payment reserved 1 to 3 years. 

    No charge for backed up DB
    Charged for backup terminated DB GB/month
    Charged for backup storage in addition to provisioned storage GB/month
    AWS backs up your database in a different availability zone.


NON-RELATIONAL DATABASES:
    A non relational database is a database that does not use the tabular
    schema of rows and columns found in most traditional database systems.
    They scale out horizontally, and are designed to scale to massive workloads.
    They prioritize speed and availability over consistency. "Eventually consistent"



Section 2: Amazon DynamoDB
    DynamoDB is a non Relational database 
    A non relational database is a database that does not use the tabular 
    schema of rows and columns found in most traditional database systems.
    They scale out horizontally, and are designed to scale to massive workloads.

    DynamoDB is a managed service that sets up and operates a non relational database in the cloud.

    Offers:
        Virtually unlimited throughput and storage
        Items can have different attributes 
        low latency for reads and writes

    Composed of Tables, items, and attributes 
    Items are a group of attributes that are uniquely identifiable among all other items.
    Attributes are atomic. 
    Two different types of keys: 
        Partition key: a simple primary key and has an attribute called the sort key 
        Partition key and sort key: a composite primary key.

    Runs exclusively on SSDs


SECTION 3: AMAZON REDSHIFT
    Quick Properties:
        Fully Managed 
        Relational Database
        Used for data analytics 
        compatible with SQL based clients and business intelligence tools



SECTION 4 AMAZON Aurora
    What is it: 
        A relational database engine that combines the speed and availability of 
        high end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost effectiveness of open source databases.

    KEY POINTS ABOUT AMAZON AURORA:
    Amazon Aurora is a high-performance, fully managed relational database service.
    It is compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL, which means you can use familiar SQL queries and tools.
    Aurora offers features such as automatic replication, high availability, and scalability.
    It is designed to provide low-latency and high-throughput performance for cloud-based applications.
