AWS INTRODUCTION NOTES 


Amazon VPC:
    Stands for Virtual Private Cloud 
    Creates a logically isolated section in the AWS cloud 

    Benefits:
        Isolation
        Custom IP Address Ranges 
        Subnets(different availability zones, but same region)
        Security Groups (Amazon firewalls)
        VPN Connectivity for secure access
        Transit Gateways: VPC can talk to each other directly 
        VPC can talk to other Amazon Services without going through the internet 

    Subnets are given 256 IP addresses, but some are reserved, so only 251 available 

    A route table specifies where things should be routed too. 
    By default, each route table has a default local pointer for local communication 


VPC Networking:
    VPC can come with an internet gateway that is scalable. It 
    helps the VPC connect to the internet

    A NAT helps the VPC connect to the internet and prevents random internet connections 
    from messing anything up. It allows address translation
    Enables instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet

    VPC endpoint: Connects your VPC to supported AWS services

    VPC peering: Connects your VPC to other VPCs

    AWS Site to Site VPN: Connects your VPC to remote networks

    AWS Transit Gateway: A hub and spoke connection alternative to VPC peering


VPC Security
    Each instance of an VPC has it's own Security group
    A security group filters traffic like a firewall 
    Default: Allow all outbound, deny all inbound 

    You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules 

    A network ACL (Access control list) is optional. It is like 
    a firewall for one or more subnets. ACL's can allow or deny traffic 
    It's stateless, meaning return traffic must be explicitly allowed
    By default, ACL's deny everything 


Amazon Route 53 
    Route 53 is a DNS web service. 
    Routes names like example.com into 192.168.1.1
    Features traffic flow
    You can buy domain names directly through the service. 
    Health check on endpoints
    Provides logging and monitoring 


Amazon CloudFront 
    Fast, secure, CDN service for global reach 
    They use edge locations to reach globally.
