DEVELOPING STORAGE SOLUTIONS, MODULE 3

The essential part of an S3 bucket are objects, buckets, and keys
keys: the name of the object
objects: the data itself
buckets: containers for objects

S3 bucket names are globally unique, and must be unique across all regions
Buckets are located in regions, and can be accessed from anywhere. 
Objects in buckets are referenced through virtual-host-style URLs
Prefixes imply a folder structure in an S3 bucket 

Two types of Meta-Data: 
    1. System-defined metadata: object creation date, size, etc.
    2. User-defined metadata: custom metadata, such as tags

Put Object:
    Use the put object API to upload objects to S3
    Use multipart if above 100MB. Must use over 5 GB

Use the Select API to retrieve only a subset of data from an object
    Use SQL expressions to filter data
    Use the Select API to retrieve only a subset of data from an object
    Use SQL expressions to filter data

Versioning is a feature that allows you to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in an S3 bucket
    Versioning is enabled at the bucket level
    Versioning is disabled by default
    Versioning is a great way to protect against unintended overwrites and deletions

You can use the delete option with two options:
    1. Versioning enabled 
        - Must delete specific version
    2. Versioning disabled
        - object is deleted
    
Three total S3 operations:
    1. PUT
    2. GET
    3. DELETE

Data Encryption:
    1. Data in Transit:
        - SSL/TLS
        - encryption before uploading to S3
    2. Data at Rest:
        - Server Side Encryption
            - S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
            - AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS)
            - Server Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys (SSE-C)
        - Client Side Encryption
            - Client Side Encryption with AWS KMS Managed Keys (CSE-KMS)
            - Client Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys (CSE-C)
