MODULE 5 NOSQL SOLUTIONS

What is DynamoDB? Fully Managed, NoSQL, database service. 
    NoSQL = SQL + unstructured, semi structured data
    Amazon handles the backend infrastructure for you
    Multiple Availability Zones
    Can use IAM 
    Backup and restore available 
    Stream processing: event driven programming (Programs are driven by user inputs, 
        or something like events happening in the system to trigger responses, it's also
        asynchronous, so it doesn't wait for a response, it just keeps going, call back 
        functions in js, event handler, event loop.)

    MS SQL server
    Oracle Database
    MySQL

Non-Relational Database: (faster, horizontal scaling, more flexible, can use dicts)
    DynamoDB

Identify the features of Amazon DynamoDB
    Tables: Contains items with attributes
    Items: Each table contains zero or more items, group of attributes, 
    Attributes: 
    Primary key: Unique identifier for table 

    Each Item has a primary key. 
    Primary key can be simple or composite. Composite is a partition key and sort key.

    An Attribute can be null, binary, boo, number string,
        set types: string set, number set, binary set
        Lists and map.
