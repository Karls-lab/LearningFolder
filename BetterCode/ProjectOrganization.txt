In this document, I'll record what I think are best practices to organize 
a python project. 


1. Put your entire project into a folder named after your project. 

2. Here are the files/folders needed in the home folder: 
    - src folder 
    - docs folder 
    - README.txt 

    README.txt:
        A short introduction, and goals of the program 
        Guide to Installing 
        Simple Example

    src FOLDER:
        A folder that contains each program entirely. 

    PROGRAM FOLDER:
